<p>Use __new__ when you need to control the creation of a new instance. Use __init__
when you need to control initialization of a new instance.</p>
<br>
<p>__new__ is the first step of instance creation. It's called first, and is responsible
for returning a new instance of your class. In contrast, __init__ doesn't return
anything; it's only responsible for initializing the instance after it's been created.</p>
<br>
<p>In general, you shouldn't need to override __new__ unless you're subclassing an
immutable type like str, int, unicode or tuple.</p>
