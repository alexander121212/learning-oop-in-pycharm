<p>Descriptor - a class that stores and controls the attributes of other classes.
In general, any class that implements one of the special methods -
__get__, __set__, __delete__, is a descriptor.</p>
<br>Example:
<br>class ExternalStorage:
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  __slots__ = ("attribute_name",)
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  __storage = {}
<br>
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  def __init __ (self, attribute_name):
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp      self.attribute_name = attribute_name
<br>
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  def __set __ (self, instance, value):
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp      self .__ storage [id (instance), self.attribute_name] = value
<br>
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  def __get __ (self, instance, owner = None):
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp      if instance is None:
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp          return self
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp      return self .__ storage [id (instance), self.attribute_name]
<br>
<br>class Point:
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  __slots__ = ()
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  x = ExternalStorage ("x")
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  y = ExternalStorage ("y")
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  def __init __ (self, x = 0, y = 0):
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp    self.x = x
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp    self.y = y
<br>
<br>P1 = Point (1,2)
<br>P2 = Point (3,4)
<p>In this case, the Point class does not have its own attributes x, y, though their causes,
    as if they are - in fact, they are stored in the descriptor ExternalStorage.</p>
<br>
<br> Now let,s do practice! Lets create descriptor named FridgeStorage, where students will stores his food!
