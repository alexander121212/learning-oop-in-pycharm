<p>Functor - a class that has a method __call__ - thus the object can be called as a function .
Example . Suppose we have a class Person, a collection of objects of this class- people need
to sort the collection by name . You can use the functor Sortkey:</p>
<br>class Functor:
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspdef __call__(self):
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspreturn None
<br>
<br>f = Functor()
<br>result = f()
<br>
<br> Now let's play with it!
