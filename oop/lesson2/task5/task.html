if we talk about the attributes of the class ,
it is worth mentioning the class constructor.
<br>
class Student:
<br>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp """this class describes
<br>
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp the average student"""
<br><br>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp debts_count = 10
<br><br>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspdef __init__(self, desireToLearn=True):
<br>
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp self.desire_to_learn = desire_to_learn
<br><br>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspdef pass_one_debt(self):
<br>
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp self.debts_count -= 1
<br><br>

   &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp def pass_all_debts(self):
<br>
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp self.debts_count = 0
<br>

student1 = Student(False)
But stop! What is difference between definition debtsCount and desireToLearn?
<br>
<p>
Both are attributes of class. The real answer lay in understanding the distinction between class and instance attributes.
</p>
<p>Python classes and instances of classes each have their own distinct namespaces represented by pre-defined
attributes Student.__dict__ and instance_of_Student.__dict__, respectively.</p>
<p>When you try to access an attribute from an instance of a class, it first looks at its instance namespace.
If it finds the attribute, it returns the associated value. If not, it then looks in the class namespace and
returns the attribute (if itâ€™s present, throwing an error otherwise).</p>

What does it need to know?
<br>
if you need to use an instances of the class , the best way to determine the attributes in constructor.
<br>
if you need to use an object of the class, as functor, the best way to determine the attributes in class namespace.
<br>
It helps you to save your programme time.
<br>Now let's play with it!
<br>
Create instance of Student class named student1, that doesn't want to learn! And student2, that want to learn.
