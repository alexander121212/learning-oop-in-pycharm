<br>Good news!
<br>We can add attributes into object of the class or instance in our code not only in class!!!
<br>For example:
<br>
<br>class Student:
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp    """this class describes
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp        the average student"""
<br>
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp    debts_count = 10
<br>
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp    def pass_one_debt(self):
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp        self.debts_count -= 1
<br>
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp    def pass_all_debts(self):
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp        self.debts_count = 0

<br>Student.faculty = "FIB"
<br>now, object Student has attribute faculty and all instances were created after this will have this attribute
<br>
<br>Let's do practice!!! Add new attribute named freeTime. Students are very busy, that's why value is 0.
<br>
And conduct experiments with it!
