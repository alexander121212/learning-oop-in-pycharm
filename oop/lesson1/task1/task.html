Before you become a cool OOP programmer you should know
<br>
How you can define classes in Python. See class definition syntax:
<br>
<br>class ClassName:
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp statement-1
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp statement-1
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp statement-1
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp ...........
<p>A Python class starts with the reserved word class, followed by the class name. Technically, that's all that's required, since a class doesn't need to inherit from any other class.
Now define your class.</p>
