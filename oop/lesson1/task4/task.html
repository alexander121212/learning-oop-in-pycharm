<br>As parameters, python classes may have methods or not.
<br>For definition method you need write function in body of class.
<br>For example:
<br>class Student:
<br>   &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp""""this class describes
<br>        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp"the average student"""
<br>
<br>    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp"subject_count = 10
<br>
<br>    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp"def pass_all_subjects(self):
<br>        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp"self.subject_count = 0
<br>
<p>Now, we have class with name Student, attribute subjectCount, and method passAllSubjects.
But method has own patameter self, what is it?</p>
<p>The first argument is the class method (the reference to the current instance) is called self.</p>
<p>This argument plays the role of the reserved word this in C ++ and Java, but self is not a reserved word
- just a convention . Despite this, it is not necessary to call it other than self.</p>
<br>
Now add method pass_one_subject which reduces the number of subjects.
