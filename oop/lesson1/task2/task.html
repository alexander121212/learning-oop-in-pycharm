<p>PEP 0257 -- Docstring Conventions tell us that docstring is a string literal that occurs as the first statement in
a module, function, class, or method definition. Such a docstring becomes the __doc__ special attribute of that object.
All modules should normally have docstrings, and all functions and classes exported by a module should also have
docstrings. Public methods (including the __init__ constructor) should also have docstrings. A package may be documented
in the module docstring of the __init__.py file in the package directory.</p>

<p>String literals occurring elsewhere in Python code may also act as documentation. They are not recognized by the
Python bytecode compiler and are not accessible as runtime object attributes (i.e. not assigned to __doc__ ), but
two types of extra docstrings may be extracted by software tools:</p>

<p>String literals occurring immediately after a simple assignment at the top level of a module, class, or __init__
method are called "attribute docstrings".
String literals occurring immediately after another docstring are called "additional docstrings".
Please see PEP 258 , "Docutils Design Specification" , for a detailed description of attribute and additional
docstrings.</p>
<br>
XXX Mention docstrings of 2.2 properties.
<br>
<p>For consistency, always use """triple double quotes""" around docstrings. Use r"""raw triple double quotes"""
if you use any backslashes in your docstrings. For Unicode docstrings, use u"""Unicode triple-quoted strings""" .
</p>
There are two forms of docstrings: one-liners and multi-line docstrings.
<br>
I think that we can believe it and try it. Add docstring and print it.
