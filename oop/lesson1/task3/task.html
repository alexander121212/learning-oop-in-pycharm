<br>Python classes may have attributes or not.
<br>For definition attributes you need write variable in body of class.
<br>For example:
<br>class Student:
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp"""this class describes
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp        the average student"""
<br>
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp    subject_count = 10
<br>
<br>if you want to know is attributes in class, you can use hasattr() function.
<br>For example, hasattr(Student, "subjectCount") give True, because our class
<br>contain attributes subjectCount.
<br>Now, let describe some attributes, for example, debtsCount = 0 (we are good students without debts).
<br>And check it.
