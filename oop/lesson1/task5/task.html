<p>Next step of our edu is understand difference between class and object of class.</p>
<p>What does it mean class?</p>
<p>Сlass - is a template , a description not only of the structure of the data
( what it can or should be ) , but also behavior , functionality of the objects of this class.
To understand what the object of the class must be imagined abstracting and understand what the object is.
Philosophy says that the object - a philosophical category expressing something that exists in reality .
Programming says that the object - it is an entity in the virtual space ,
has a certain status and behavior , has given values ​​of properties ( attributes)
and operations on them ( methods). Now we learn programming, so let's build on the second definition.
So, we have object which has status and behavior and we have class that can describe status and behavior
in terms of attributes and methods. Therefore , the class object - an object state and behavior which describes the class
Instance is specific object of this class.</p>
<p>I don't want to break your mind. Let's see example.</p>
<br><b>this is class</b>
<br>class Student:
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp    """this class describes
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp        the average student"""
<br>
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspdebtsCount = 10
<br>
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp    def pass_one_debt(self):
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp        self.debts_count -= 1
<br>
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp    def pass_all_debts(self):
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp        self.debts_count = 0
<br>
<br><b>This is object of the class</b>
<br>    Student.debts_count
<br>
<br><b> this is instance of the object of the class</b>
<br>student = Student()
<br>
<br>
<p>Our class is Student. Our instace of the class is student. He can pass 1 debt or all debts - this is his behaivior.
student has 10 debts - this is his status.</p>
<br>if wee want to see his count of debts, we will ask like:
<br><i>student.debts_count</i>
<br>if student wants to pass 1 debt, he will do it like:
<br><i>student.pass_one_debt()</i>
<br>
<br>Let's create class instance student and help him to pass all debts!!!!
