<p>The term polymorphism, in the OOP lingo, refers to the ability of an
object to adapt the code to the type of the data it is processing.</p>

<p>Polymorphism has two major applications in an OOP language. The first is that an object may provide
different implementations of one of its methods depending on the type of the input parameters. The
second is that code written for a given type of data may be used on data with a derived type, i.e.
methods understand the class hierarchy of a type.</p>

<p>In Python polymorphism is one of the key concepts, and we can say that it is a built-in feature. Let
us deal with it step by step.</p>

<p>First of all, you know that in Python the type of a variable is not explicitly declared. Beware that this
does not mean that Python variables are untyped. On the contrary, everything in Python has a type, it
just happens that the type is implicitly assigned.</p>

<br>when we wrote constructor of our class! We didn't check datatype of desireToLearn!
<br>It's very dangerous! We must correct it!
