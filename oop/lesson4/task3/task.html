<p>Of course, a language feature would not be worthy of the name class
without supporting inheritance. The syntax for a derived class definition looks like this:</p>
<br>
<br>class DerivedClassName(BaseClassName):
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&lt;statement-1&gt;
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp.
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp.
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp.
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&lt;statement-1&gt;
<br>
<p>Now we have 2 classes! We need that StudentOfRadik inherits Student, has own method named sleep_sweety and override
base class method play_truant, that print something before and after original method(use super())</p>
