<p>Encapsulation - restrict access to the objects of the components ( methods and variables ) .
Encapsulation makes some of the components are accessible only within the class .</p>

<p>Encapsulation in Python works only at the level of agreement among programmers about what attributes
are public and which - internal.</p>

<p>Single underlining in the beginning of the name attribute indicates that a variable or method is not
intended for use outside the class methods , however, is available on the attribute name.</p>

class A:
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp    def _private(self):
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp        print("This is private method!")
<br>
<br>a = A()
<br>a._private()
<br>
<p>The double underscore at the beginning of the name attribute gives more protection :
the attribute is unavailable for this name. </p>
<br>class B:
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     def __private(self):
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp         print("This is private method!")
<br>
<br>b = B()
<br>b._B__private()
<p>However, it does not fully protect , as an attribute still remains available under
the name _ClassName__AttributeName</p>

<p>Students very likes to eat cookies and drink coffee, but students are poor and hungry!
    That's why they hide cookies and coffee that
other students do not find them. </p>
<br>your neighbor hide cookies and coffee! Find them!
