Methods are just like functions, with two differences:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Methods are defined inside a class definition in order to make the relationship between the class and the method explicit.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The syntax for invoking a method is different from the syntax for calling a function.
<br>
<br>for example:
<br>class Student:
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp    """this class describes
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp        the average student"""
<br>
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp    debts_count = 10
<br>
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp    def __init__(self, desire_to_learn=True):
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp        self.desire_to_learn = desire_to_learn
<br>
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp    def pass_one_debt(self):
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp        self.debts_count -= 1
<br>
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp    def pass_all_debts(self):
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp        self.debts_count = 0

<br>

Class Student has 3 methods: constructor, pass_cne_debt and pass_all_debts.
<br>
Let's create new method named play_truant which has 2 attributes are self and victory_cry.
<br> And print funny text
