What the difference between bound method and function?
<br>
<br>class Student:
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp    """this class describes
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp        the average student"""
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp    debts_count = 10
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp    def __init__(self, desire_to_learn=True):
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp        self.desire_to_learn = desire_to_learn
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp    def pass_one_debt(self):
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp        self.debts_count -= 1
<br>
<br>student = Student()
<br>print(student.pass_one_debt)
<br>print(Student.pass_one_debt)
<p>this code print<br>
&lt;bound method Student.pass_one_debt of &lt;__main__.Student object at 0x7f7679568358&gt;&gt;<br/>
    &lt;function Student.pass_one_debt at 0x7f76795637b8&gt;
</p>
<p>A function is created by the def statement, or by lambda. When a function appears within
the body of a class statement (or is passed to a type class construction call), it is transformed
into an unbound method. When a function is accessed on a class instance, it is transformed into
a bound method, that automatically supplies the instance to the method as the first self parameter.</p>
<p>In python 3 unbound method is missing. And  when a function appears within
the body of a class statement, it is function type now </p>
<br>
Experiment with it!
