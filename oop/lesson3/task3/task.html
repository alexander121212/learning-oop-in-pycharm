Now I want to know what the difference between staticmethod and classmethod. And for what they need, of course!
class Student:
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp    """this class describes
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp        the average student"""
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp    debts_count = 10
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp    def __init__(self, desire_to_learn=True):
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp        self.desire_to_learn = desire_to_learn
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp    def pass_one_debt(self):
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp        self.debts_count -= 1
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp    def pass_all_debts(self):
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp        self.debts_count = 0
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp    def play_truant(self, victory_cry):
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp        print((victory_cry + " I'am play truant this boring lessons!!! object is %s")%self)
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp    @classmethod
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp    def class_play_truant(cls, victory_cry):
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp        print((victory_cry + " I'am play truant this boring lessons!!! object is %s")%cls)
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp    @staticmethod
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp    def static_play_truant(victory_cry):
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp        print(victory_cry + " I'am play truant this boring lessons!!!")
<br>
<br>student = Student()
<br>Below is the usual way an object instance calls a method. The object instance, a, is implicitly passed as the first argument.
<br>
<br>student.Student(1)
<br>executing foo(&lt;__main__.Student object at 0x7f2fffee24e0&gt;)
<br><b>With classmethods</b>, the class of the object instance is implicitly passed as the first argument instead of self.
<br>
<br>student.class_play_truant('yeeea')
<br># executing class_play_truant(&lt;class &#39;__main__.Student&#39;&gt;)
<br>You can also call class_play_truant using the class. In fact, if you define something to be a classmethod, it is probably
<br>because you intend to call it from the class rather than from a class instance. Student.play_truant('yeeehi') would have raised a
<br>TypeError, but Student.class_play_truant('yeeehi') works just fine:
<br>
<br>Student.class_play_truant('yeeehi')
<br># executing class_play_truant(class &#39;__main__.Student&#39;)
<br>One use people have found for class methods is to create inheritable alternative constructors.
<br>
<p><b>With staticmethods</b>, neither self (the object instance) nor  cls (the class) is implicitly
passed as the first argument. They behave like plain functions except that you can call them from an
instance or the class:</p>
<br>
<br>student.static_play_truant('ufffffff')
<br># executing static_play_truant
<br>
<br>Student.static_play_truant('hi')
<br># executing static_play_truant(hi)
<br>Staticmethods are used to group functions which have some logical connection with a class to the class.
<br>
<p>static_play_truant is just a function, but when you call student.static_play_truant you don't just get
the function, you get a "partially applied" version of the function with the object instance a bound
as the first argument to the function. foo expects 2 arguments, while a.foo only expects 1 argument.
</p>
a is bound to foo. That is what is meant by the term "bound" below:
<br>
<br>print(student.play_truant)
<br># &lt;bound method Student.play_truant of &lt;__main__.Student object at 0x7f22ae5d3588&gt;&gt;
<br>With student.class_play_truant, a is not bound to class_play_truant, rather the class Student is bound to class_play_truant.
<br>
<br>print(student.class_play_truant)
<br>&lt;bound method Student.play_truant of &lt;__main__.Student object at 0x7f22ae5d3588&gt;&gt;
<p>Here, with a staticmethod, even though it is a method, student.static_play_truant just returns a good 'ole
function with no arguments bound. static_play_truant expects 1 argument, and student.static_play_truant expects 1 argument too.
</p>
<br>print(student.static_play_truant)
<br># &lt;function Student.static_play_truant at 0x7fe7618138c8&gt;
<br>
Now, let play with it)))
